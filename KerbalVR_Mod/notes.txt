when in IVA:

InternalCamera:
		Scene path	"internalSpace/mk2InlineInternal interior/model/Squad/Spaces/mk2InlineInternal/mk2InlineIVA(Clone)/Seat1/Defred Kerman/IVA EyeTransform/InternalCameraVRAnchor/InternalCamera"	string

		This object contains both the InternalCamera component and the Camera component

		InteractionSystem is also a child of the InternalCameraVRAnchor

FlightCamera.LateUpdate 
	if (updateActive) // note - when in IVA, updateActive is false
		UpdateCameraTransform
			sets this object's transform according to cameraFX (wobble)



InternalCamera.Update
	UpdateState
		sets this object's local transform according to cameraFX (wobble)
	sets flightcamera's transform according to this object's transform

InternalCamera_UpdateState_Patch.Postfix
	copies the internalcamera's local position and rotation to its parent transform (the vranchor)
	this allows for wobble
