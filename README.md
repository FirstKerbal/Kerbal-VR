# KerbalVR

An add-on for Kerbal Space Program (KSP) to enable the use of a virtual reality headset
(HTC Vive, Valve Index, Windows MR, Oculus Rift, etc), as supported by OpenVR.

### FOLLOW the [Install Guide](https://github.com/Vivero/Kerbal-VR/wiki/Install-Guide), as there is a little bit more setup compared to other KSP mods.

**Built for KSP v1.9.1**

This is a forever-WIP mod to allow the use of VR headsets in KSP. The primary focus is
for flight control in IVA, but can also be used for room-scale viewing inside the VAB or SPH.

IVA in VR puts you inside the cockpit of your craft. You can control the craft using your
VR controllers, which can be configured through SteamVR controller bindings. More immersive features for the
cockpit may come sometime in the future.

EVA in VR allows you to explore planets, using teleportation as a means for locomotion.

Room-scale VR in the VAB and SPH allows you to walk around inside the building and see your craft at a 1:1 scale.

Performance will vary wildly between setups. There is an infinite combination of PC specs,
video cards, VR rendering resolutions, headset refresh rates, etc. It is difficult to achieve
a smooth experience, but you may try the **Performance Tips** below.

## Performance Tips

You may need to tone down the graphics for best performance. Try these in the Settings menu, under the Graphics tab:
