Can we subclass one of the cameras and replace it in the hierarchy?


------------------------------------------
internal controls
mk1pod:
	// mk1pod flight stick:
	// internalSpace / mk1pod_IVA interior / model / Squad / Spaces / mk1pod_IVA / mk1pod_IVA(Clone) / rotation / pilot seat_01 / seat / Stick002
	throttle: Cylinder007

mk1 cockpit:
	seat is a prop, but the stick and throttle aren't broken out into subobjects
	will probably need to swap these out for alcor seats

mk1 lander can:
	same as mk1pod
	joystick: rotation/pilot seat/seat/Stick002
	throttle: rotation/pilot seat/seat/Cylinder007
